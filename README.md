## üöÄ About Me

üéì I have a background in petroleum engineering degree from the University of Pembangunan Nasional ‚ÄúVeteran‚Äù Yogyakarta (Indonesia). Skilled at
analyzing data, identifying solutions, and logic capability. I also learned python programming language, starting from data analysis both using **python** and **MySQL**, data visualization using both python and **tableau**, and then creating **machine learning** models.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Projects
### Python Fundamentals
- [Yellow Pages](https://github.com/fnkhairudin/YellowPages): A simple program to record companies un-confidential data based on CURD systems (Create, Update, Read, and Delete). I also provide a log systems, so that the program can track any changes, such as what and when they occurred.

### Data Visualization
- [Customer Supermarket Analysis](https://github.com/fnkhairudin/Customer-Supermarket-Analysis): Design marketing strategies aimed at customer segmentation based on data analysis.

### Machine Learning
- [Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/fnkhairudin/Hotel-Booking-Demand): Create a machine learning model that can predict whether a hotel customer will cancel an order or not. I'm using balanced accuracy as an evaluation metric due to imbalance label and also because of the importance of both positive and negative classes.
- [Permeability of Reservoir Rock Prediction](https://github.com/fnkhairudin/Permeability-Reservoir-Rock-Prediction/tree/main): Build a machine learning model for predicting permeability reservoir rock based on porosity and connate water saturation (Swc) and also deploy model in streamlit.
- [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Job Roles Salary Prediction](https://github.com/fnkhairudin/Data-Scientist-Salary-Prediction): Build a model and streamlit web app for predicting data scienctist job salary based on several features such as experience level, employment type, job position, job scope, etc.
